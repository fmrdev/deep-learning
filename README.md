# Rotational Invariance in Convolutional Neural Networks

The purpose of this project is to explore rotational invariance in Convolutional Neural Networks using Max-Pooling.  

## Setup  
Install the following Python packages to run the code in the project:  
1. [Theano, bleeding edge.](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html#bleeding-edge-install-instructions)
2. Keras: `pip install keras`
3. iPython: `pip install ipython`
4. [Optional] [Hualos](https://github.com/fchollet/hualos), for live visualization of loss function.
